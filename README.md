## Main insight

 The GDP only affects life expectancy to a certain extent. You need only a moderate GDP improvement
    to increase life expectancy to a comparible level of a first world country This shows that it does not take
    a country to be in the top of the economy to have a good life expectancy. Despite variability in GDP, 
    life expectancy stabilises after a certain income.
