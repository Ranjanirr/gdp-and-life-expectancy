- How does the GDP of a country relate to the life expectancy? We often assume that countries with higher GDPs also have higher life expectancy because they have more healthcare resources so people can live longer. But what are the details? What GDP is the threshold to make the life expectancy healthy? How have both GDP and life expectancy changed over time? Is it possible for some countries to have low GDP and high life expectancy, or vice versa?

## Main insight

 The GDP only affects life expectancy to a certain extent. You need only a moderate GDP improvement to increase life expectancy to a comparible level of a first world country This shows that it does not take a country to be in the top of the economy to have a good life expectancy. Despite variability in GDP, life expectancy stabilises after a certain income.
    
Over the years, life expectancy is plateaued for the high expectancy countries but increasing for the low expectancy countries. GDP increases throughout the years for the high income countries but plateaus for the low income countries.
